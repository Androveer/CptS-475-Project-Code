# CptS-475-Project-Code
Code from the CptS 475 Fall 2021 Total Dissolved Gas Model Project. The following files are contained

- [project.py](https://github.com/Androveer/CptS-475-Project-Code/blob/main/project.py) This file contains my initial attempt at creating a dense neural network. It will display predicted results plotted against actual results, as well as display the error between the training and testing dataset. It is a simple neural network composed of a simple dense layer.
- [lstm.py](https://github.com/Androveer/CptS-475-Project-Code/blob/main/lstm.py) This file contains an implementation of an LSTM that can be used to predict time series data. It was adapted to use the given project data. Predicted results and test results are plotted against each other, as well as error of training and testing data over epochs. Note, the code is adapted from a tutorial for LSTMs predicting time series data, the original code can be found at https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/

Due to the size of the dataset, the csv files were larger than the file size limit imposed by github, and as a result, cannot be uploaded into the repository.
